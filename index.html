		<h1>Some Music I Like &amp; Why: An Opinion Piece</h1>
	</header>

	<p>Hello, and welcome to a page of some music that I like! This is by no means a comprehensive list of all of my favorite music, or even my top favorites (I couldn't decide on an ordered list if I tried anyway). These are just a few bands/musicians that I'm currently jamming out to, and I believe everyone should give a listen to them all at least once!</p>

		A couple of years ago a friend told me she really liked a musician named Mitski. Well, I gave her music a listen, and initially decided it wasn't my cup of tea. However, I know some things tend to grow on me after multiple exposures (like bleu cheese and exercising), thus I continued listening to her abstract soundscapes until I acquired an appreciation. Let me tell you, I'm so glad I did, because Mitski's sound is one full of beautiful subtleties. Every time I hear her, I'm surrounded by a dark-purple, sparkly aura. Her music is ominous yet enticing, and sort of swallows you whole. To understand what I mean, one must listen themselves. I accredit Mitski to being a catalyst to having a more refined taste in music.

		I have one word for this band: HYPE. I only recently discoved this fiery K-Pop quartet through a song they're featured in called Sour Candy on Lady Gaga's new album, Chromatica. The song's Korean lyrics led me to research the featured girl-band, and for weeks now I've been jamming out to their tunes. I'd call this one a guilty pleasure, because their content isn't very deep or meaningful, just EXTREMELY catchy and high-production. If you just want to turn your brain off for a while and dance like there's no pandemic, this is your band. The girls, Jennie, Lisa, Jisoo, and Rose, are expert dancers as well! Their music videos are some of the best I've ever seen.

		When you see the above photo of Tennis, you might assume they're some sort of blast from the past. I mean, those HAIRCUTS, though. Tennis is actually a modern-day dream pop/lo-fi duo, and their vintage aesthetic ripples through both sound and appearance. A lot of indie lo-fi music seems to blend together due to lack of originality. Tennis's content has a creative spin that always stands out. Their sound is relaxed yet energetic.

		The final musician to be discussed is one I hold dearly, Caroline Polachek. I first discovered her when her songs would periodically play on various Spotify radio stations I would listen to, and I kept noticing how distinctive her voice sounded. Finally, I checked out her one and only album, Pang, and fell in love. I'd easily call her a creative genuis. Her voice can reach great heights much like that of an opera singer, and she flexes this talent regularly in an elegant and modern way.

	<h2>Death Cab for Cutie</h2>

	<article class = "description">
		Death Cab for Cutie is my favorite band of all-time. I have one tattoo, which is an album cover from this band. Their music is soft and melodic, with deeply metaphorical lyricism that paints a picture for the listener. Their music has the continuous capability to make any tense or unhappy moment in my life more relaxed for me. I turn to Death Cab in times of need and happy times alike. They have been around since 1997 and I have seen them in concert numerous times since age 12. The bandmates consist of lead vocalist Ben Gibbard, bass guitarist Nick Harmer, drummer Jason McGerr, guitarist Dave Depper, and keyboardist Zac Rae. All bandmates play multiple intruments in the band. Death Cab for Cutie has released 9 amazing studio albums.
